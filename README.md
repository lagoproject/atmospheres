  <h3 align="center">The LAGO Monthly Averaged Atmospheric Profiles Library</h3>
  <p align="center">
    To optimize the simulation of the expected background or signals flux at each site, we [developed a method](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjp-2020-0561) to obtain the monthly-averaged local atmospheric profiles, obtained from the instantaneous [Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00379) profiles.

## LAGO sites atmospheric profiles

In this repository we storage the atmospheric profiles for all the LAGO sites described in the [LAGO DMP](https://lagoproject.github.io/DMP/), starting in January 2015. While it is not exclusive, it is mainly intended to be used within the [ARTI](https://github.com/lagoproject/arti) atmospheric radiation background tool suite. 

## Proposed features

See the [open issues](https://github.com/lagoproject/arti/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Acknowledgement

This package includes a slightly modified version of the [gdastool](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.astropartphys.2020.102470), a publicly available code to obtain parameterized GDAS atmospheric profiles for user-specified time and location. This code is included in the [CORSIKA](https://www.iap.kit.edu/corsika/) distribution since version CORSIKA v7.6300.

## Contact

This library is mantained by H. Asorey (@asoreyh) for the LAGO simulation group. Atmosheric instantaneous profiles need large storage and were not included in this public repository, but are available upon request. Please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://lagoproject.net/contact.html) for further requests or comments.
