## LAGO sites atmospheric profiles

To optimize the simulation of the expected background or signals flux at each site, we [developed a method](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjp-2020-0561) to obtain the monthly-averaged local atmospheric profiles, obtained from the instantaneous [Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00379) profiles. 

In this repository we storage the atmospheric profiles for all the LAGO sites described in the [LAGO DMP](https://lagoproject.github.io/DMP/), starting in January 2015. While it is not exclusive, it is mainly intended to be used within the [ARTI](https://github.com/lagoproject/arti) atmospheric radiation background toolsuite. Atmosheric instantaneous profiles need large storage and were not included in this public repository, but are available upon request. Please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://lagoproject.net/contact.html) for further requests or comments.
