# Atmospheres 

To optimize the simulation of the expected background or signals flux at each site, we developed a method to extract instantaneous GDAS atmospheric profiles and average them for each site. In this repository we storage the instantaneous and monthly averaged atmospheric profiles for all the sites described in the LAGO DMP, and it is intended to be used with ARTI.
Here we only included averaged profiles as instantaneous profiles need large storage. Please don't hesitate to contact us if your need some particular file.
